Chef Server Installation on EC2 Ubuntu 14.04

Three Componenets

Chef is a configuration management tool written in Ruby and Erlang.
It uses pure-Ruby, domain-specific language(DSL) for writting system configuration recipes



The typical Chef environment is made up of 3 parts:
-> The Chef server
-> Workstation
-> nodes

The Chef server used to store configuration data and administer access rights.
This will serve as a hub for our other machines.
We will also install a workstation that will allow us to interact with our server and build our configuration policies.
This is where we will do the work to manage our infrastructure environment.

Chef's three main components:

1] Server acts as a hub that is available to every node.
Chef server is the brain of the operation.
It stores information about our infrastructure.
All chef client nodes will be registered with the server.
The server holds all the cookbooks, recipes and policies.
Clients communicate with the server to get the right configuration elements from the server and apply it to the nodes.

2] Workstation is the development machine from which configuration elements like cookbooks, recipes and policies are defined.
Workstation is where we will spend most of our time working with Chef.
It's the same place we do our development or sysadmin work.
From our workstation, we'll author Chef cookbooks, upload them to our Chef server, and more.
Configuration are synchronized with  the chef-repo and uploaded to the server with knife command.

3] Nodes contain chef-client which performs all the infrastructure automation.
A node is a server in our infrastructure.
Nodes are the computers that we manage using Chef.
A node can be physical computer, virtual machine, instance in our public or private cloud environment, or even a switch or router in our network.
