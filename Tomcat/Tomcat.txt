##### TOMCAT DOCUMENTATION ####


$CATALINA_HOME. This represents the root of your Tomcat installation.

Tomcat may be configured for multiple instances by defining $CATALINA_BASE for each instance.
If muliple intances are not configured, $CATALINA_BASE is the same as $CATALINA_HOME.

These are some of the key tomcat directories:

* /bin - Startup, shutdown, and other scripts.

* /conf - Configuration files and related DTDs. The most important file in here is server.xml. It is the main configuration file for the container.

* /logs - Log files are here by default.

* /webapps - This is where your webapps go.


- - - TOMCAT SETUP - - -

Tomcat can be run as a daemon using the jsvc tool from the commons-daemon project. Source tarballs for jsvc are included with the Tomcat binaries, and need to be compiled. 
Building jsvc requires a C ANSI compiler (such as GCC), GNU autoconf, and a JDK.

Before running the script, the JAVA_HOME environment variable should be set to the base path of the JDK. Alternatively, when calling the ./configure script, the path of the JDK may be specified using the --with-java parameter, such as ./configure --with-java=/usr/java.

Using the following commands should result in a compiled jsvc binary, located in the $CATALINA_HOME/bin folder. This assumes that GNU TAR is used, and the CATALINA_HOME is an environment variable pointing to the base path of the Tomcat installation.

Please note that you should use the GNU make (gmake) instead of the native BSD make on FreeBSD systems.

____________________________________________
| cd $CATALINA_HOME/bin
| tar xvfz commons-daemon-native.tar.gz
| cd commons-daemons-10.x-native-src/unix
| ./Configure
| make
| cp jsvc ../..
| cd ../..

Tomcat can then be run as a daemon using the following commands.
_____________________________________________
| CATALINA_BASE=$CATALINA_HOME
| cd $CATALINA_HOME
| ./bin/jsvc \
|     -classpath $CATALINA_HOME/bin/bootstrap.jar \
|     -outfile $CATALINA_BASE/logs/catalina.out \
|     -errfile $CATALINA_BASE/logs/catalina.err \
|     -Dcatalina.home=$CATALINA_HOME \
|     -Dcatalina.base=$CATALINA_BASE \
|     -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager \
|     -Djava.util.logging.config.file=$CATALINA_BASE/conf/logging.properties \
